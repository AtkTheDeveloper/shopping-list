# Shopping-List Project
This is a basic shopping list project I made while studying <em><strong>DOM Manipulation & Events</strong></em>

## Overview
In this project, the html structure was very basic. Just a couple of `<ul>, <input> and <button>` tags. The main magic happens in the javascript file. Everything was created via Javascript and appended to their respective elements.
